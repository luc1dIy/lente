# lente
lente - lens/glasses, spring

### note
***NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED.*** \
***NO PRS WILL BE ACCEPTED.*** \
the repo was originally intended to be private - i am not interested in critique or issues you may be having.

### about
this repo is a mess - the only reason why it is a) a repo and b) public is because computercraft lacks the utilities to properly interact with external tooling... i've been using gitget to transfer files (locally -> computer) hence the 500 commits to debug things as I find the in-game editor a pain.

### install & run
**TODO** install script, provide builds, start-up script too?
1) `pastebin get W5ZkVYSi gitget`
2) `mkdir lente`
3) `gitget luc1dIy lente master lente`
4) `cd lente`
5) `init.lua`
